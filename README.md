## Tech Stack
- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)  
- [Blowfish Theme](https://blowfish.page/)  
- [Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/)  
- [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/)  
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD)  


## Deployment Workflow
1. Push changes to the **main** branch on GitHub.  
2. GitHub triggers Cloudflare Workers via Wrangler.  
3. Wrangler runs the **build script (`build.sh`)**, which:  
   - Builds the Hugo site.  
   - Deploys the static files to Cloudflare.  
4. The site updates automatically ðŸŽ‰  


## Local Development
Run the blog locally with Hugo:

```bash
# Install Hugo (extended version recommended)
brew install hugo      # macOS
sudo apt install hugo  # Ubuntu/Debian

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ashlin-a/personal-blog.git
cd personal-blog

# Start local dev server
hugo server -D
````

Then open [http://localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313).


## Manual Deployment

You can also deploy manually if needed:

```bash
# Install Wrangler
npm install -g wrangler

# Publish to Cloudflare
wrangler publish
```
